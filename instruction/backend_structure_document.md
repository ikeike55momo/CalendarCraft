# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document provides a clear overview of the backend for our web application designed for team attendance and schedule management. The backend plays a critical role as it handles data storage, user authentication, API integrations, and overall business logic. It’s designed to support a small team with one administrator and several members, ensuring that features like calendars, attendance tracking, and task management run smoothly. Every aspect, from Google API interactions to role-based permissions, is carefully considered to meet the project’s needs.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend is built around a simple yet robust architecture that emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and performance. The system uses frameworks such as Next.js and NextAuth.js to manage server-side logic and authentication respectively. The design follows modern best practices by handling business logic on the server side and offloading intensive tasks like API syncing to scheduled jobs. This architecture enables the creation of a reliable and easy-to-maintain environment where new features can be added without disrupting existing services.

## Database Management

For data management, we rely on Neon powered PostgreSQL. The database is structured to support various components of the application including events, attendance, tasks, projects, and user roles. Special attention is given to handling multiple break times within the attendance tracking module. Data is neatly organized in tables to ensure that each entity is easily accessible, and relationships between them are clearly defined. This setup not only supports the current requirements but also provides room for future enhancements if needed.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend exposes its features via well-designed APIs. We primarily use RESTful endpoints to enable communication between the frontend and backend. These APIs manage functions such as calendar synchronization, task updates, attendance recording, and data imports from Google Sheets. Each endpoint is tailored to serve a specific purpose. For instance, one endpoint handles Google Sheets imports using both scheduled (via Vercel Cron jobs) and manual triggers, while another endpoint handles the export of the past 20 days of events to a new Google Calendar. These endpoints ensure that data flows seamlessly between different parts of the system and integrated platforms.

## Hosting Solutions

The entire backend is hosted on Vercel, leveraging their robust cloud infrastructure. Vercel’s platform is chosen for its proven reliability, ease of use, and excellent support for Next.js applications. The hosting solution helps streamline continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes, enabling automatic deployments and reducing downtime. The cloud environment provided by Vercel is cost-effective and designed to scale as the user base grows, ensuring that our backend remains responsive and available.

## Infrastructure Components

Several infrastructure components work together to ensure optimal performance and user experience. Load balancing is implicitly managed by Vercel’s global edge network, which ensures that traffic is distributed efficiently across servers. Caching mechanisms are incorporated to speed up data retrieval and reduce server load. Furthermore, content delivery networks (CDNs) are used to serve static assets quickly, making the application responsive even during high traffic. Together, these components work in tandem to provide a stable and fast environment for our backend operations.

## Security Measures

Security is a prime consideration in our backend design. We utilize NextAuth.js with Google OAuth to enforce robust authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data. Role-based access control is implemented to give administrators full control while limiting permissions for team members. Additionally, data encryption is applied where necessary to protect sensitive user information. These measures are designed not only to secure user data but also to maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping the backend healthy and efficient is achieved through the use of advanced monitoring tools. Automated systems continuously check the performance of APIs, database operations, and server responses. Alerts and logs are in place to notify the team of any potential issues, ensuring that problems can be addressed quickly. Maintenance strategies include regular updates and patches to the software, as well as backups of critical data to prevent loss during unforeseen incidents. These practices help guarantee the backend stays reliable and current with evolving requirements.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend for our team attendance and schedule management application is a well-organized and secure system. It leverages Neon's PostgreSQL for robust database management and integrates seamlessly with Google APIs to provide unique features such as daily imports from Google Sheets and synchronized exports to Google Calendar. The use of NextAuth.js for authentication, along with a clear API structure and Vercel for hosting, ensures that the system is both efficient and scalable. This thoughtful design not only addresses the immediate project needs but also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, setting our project apart by its reliability and attention to detail.
