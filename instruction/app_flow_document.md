# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a web-based tool designed to help a team of 10 manage their attendance and scheduling. The main purpose of the app is to allow users to view and record their work attendance along with managing tasks and projects. Users have the option to switch between a personal calendar view, which shows only their own events, and a team calendar view, which aggregates the schedules of all team members. The system integrates with external services such as Google Sheets for automatic and manual data imports as well as Google Calendar for exporting upcoming events. It is built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel, with a PostgreSQL database and a secure sign-in process using NextAuth.js with Google OAuth.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first visits the application they are greeted by a landing page where they are prompted to sign in using their Google account via NextAuth.js. The sign-in process ensures that users are securely authenticated and their role within the system is determined as either an administrator or a team member. Because the application relies on Google OAuth, a typical sign-up process is simplified, without the need for a separate email or password registration step. In the event a returning user needs to sign back in, the same Google sign-in process is used. In case there is any issue with login, users are guided towards Google account recovery processes rather than traditional password resets.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, all users are directed to the main dashboard. This dashboard serves as the central hub of the application. On the dashboard the user can choose between a personal calendar view or a team calendar view. The personal calendar displays only events such as planned attendance, actual work logs, and individual tasks that belong to the logged-in user. The team calendar aggregates data for the entire team, showing attendance records and tasks for all members. Navigation is straightforward with clear options to access task management screens and additional details such as project management modules in the administration section for authorized users. There are also links to export functionality which create a new Google Calendar with the user’s upcoming tasks and events.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When interacting with the calendar, users experience a dynamic and interactive grid where each date cell is clickable. On clicking a date cell a modal window opens giving the option to add or edit details. In this modal, users can enter the name of the event, select the start and end times, choose the type of attendance (for example telework, on-site work), record check-in and check-out details, as well as include multiple break periods if needed. Tasks can be added in the same modal or from a dedicated task management screen where task details such as title, associated project, tags and deadline can be entered. If any task is marked complete it is visually updated in the task management area and also reflected in the project management section where projects act as parent entities for tasks. Administrators enjoy additional navigation links that lead to a management panel where they can import data from Google Sheets, either manually through an import button or automatically through scheduled daily jobs that run at midnight. This panel also provides management features for team members and projects, ensuring that only authorized actions are taken in these sensitive areas. When users decide to export their schedule to Google Calendar, they click on a dedicated export button available on the settings or calendar screen. This action creates a new calendar for them on Google Calendar that includes upcoming events for the next twenty days, and if any changes are made later they can manually trigger an update. Overall the transition from one page or module to another is designed to be seamless, with natural flows from the dashboard to detailed modals and specialized management panels.

## Settings and Account Management

Although the core focus is on scheduling and attendance, the application offers settings for users to manage their personal information and preferences. Users can access a settings page where they can view and update their contact information and manage notification preferences, such as the alert system for task deadlines. Since authentication is handled through Google, there is no traditional password management system inside the app. If a user needs to sign out, there is an easily accessible sign-out option within the interface. Once any changes are made in the settings, the user can easily navigate back to the main dashboard without disrupting their overall experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application includes error handling designed to guide users back to a normal state if anything goes wrong. If users enter invalid data into any of the entry forms, clear error messages are displayed within the same modal window, prompting users to correct their information. In cases where there is lost connectivity or issues with external APIs such as Google Sheets or Google Calendar, the interface either displays a notification or a fallback page that indicates the problem. For import or export tasks that fail, the system provides minimal error messages to let the user know that the action was not successful, and instructions are given on how to retry. In these cases the user is never left stranded and always has a clear path to return to normal workflow either through reattempting the action or navigating back to the dashboard.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The complete journey in the application starts with a secure sign-in that confirms the user’s identity through Google OAuth. Once signed in, the user is guided to the dashboard where they choose between a personal or a team view of the calendar. The intuitive user interface, built around interactive modals for editing attendance, scheduling, and task inputs, ensures that each action flows smoothly to the next. Administrators have the added benefit of a specialized control panel for importing data from Google Sheets, managing team members and projects, and handling critical administrative operations. By providing clear navigation from the authentication process through every feature and back to the settings, the application guarantees a streamlined experience focused on effective attendance management and scheduling. This cohesive journey meets the goals of both routine daily use and robust team management while maintaining ease of use on desktop environments.
